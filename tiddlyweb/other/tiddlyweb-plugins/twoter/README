Twoter is a application of TiddlyWeb that makes it possible
to go around the internet, select some text in a page, click
a bookmarklet, and have the selected text, url and title of the
page saved to a secured location on a TiddlyWeb server.

You can then review the created Twotes in a TiddlyWiki and do
things with them (import them other places, add tags, add notes,
all the usual Tiddly things).

Unfortunately this doesn't work all that well. A combination of
browser security policies and techniques used on websites makes it
hard to reliably capture text. For this tool to work, someone
with a better understanding of such things needs to give it the
once over.

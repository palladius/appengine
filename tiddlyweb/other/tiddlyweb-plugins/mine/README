NOTE: THIS IS OUT OF DATE CODE, NO LONGER MAINTAINED.

An administrative interface for people to make TiddlyWebWikis of
their own, with access control set up as they like.

Flow goes something like this:

* Un-auth user is shown:
** a list of recipes they can read, with links to tiddler list and wiki view
** a login link
* Auth user is shown:
** a (different list) of recipes they can read, with links to tiddler list and wiki view
** a list of recipes they own, with link to edit, delete
** a create interface

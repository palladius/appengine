This directory contains a collection of TiddlyWeb plugins. Some are quite
mature, others less so. Most have a README explaining their state.

These plugins may be of use, either to use directly or as examples
of techniques to use when creating your own plugins.

Plugins that have reached a reasonable level of stability have
been packaged and are distributed from PyPI:

    http://pypi.python.org/pypi?%3Aaction=search&term=tiddlywebplugins

Some plugins now have their own repositories on GitHub, have
a browse of

    http://github.com/tiddlyweb

Look to http://tiddlyweb.com/ for more information.

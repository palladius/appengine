Synopsis

This file tries to have all possible GAE repos I can find on the internet

Projects
--------

My projects:

- `chatone`. My personal chat project, copied/inspired by Code in the Cloud book.
- `provapally`. Code I copied for test from google tutorial (doesnt work afaik)

Other people:

- `mpr312`: interesting small app (python) where API keys are traken from DataStore. To be studied
- `appengine-search`: Search test app (python). Uses Task Queue API to schedule seatrch indexing, I guess.
- `appengine_csv`: dunno. I see encoding, probably it handles CSV :) @template
- `dknbot`: does some XMPP stuff, probably shortening URLs..
- `flask-appengine-template`: super full featured and documented app (python). Boilerplate project template for running a Flask-based application

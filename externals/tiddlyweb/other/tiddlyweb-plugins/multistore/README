A storage implementation for TiddlyWeb that can read and write
to and from multiple other storage implementations.

That is every time a read or a write operation is done through multistore,
that operation is called on the other configured implementations, so, for
example, when a tiddler is written, it can be written to multiple places.

This is for the entire data store. Other plugins which make different
storage decisions based what bag is being read or written to are being
explored.

See tiddlywebconfig.py for example configuration.

REQUIRES TIDDLYWEB 0.9.38

!Issues

* Revision ids increase per time the tiddler is written, so if you 
  write a tiddler three times via one put in multistore, the revision
  on the tiddler object will be 3. If revisions are being used correctly
  this shouldn't be a problem, but if people are relying on the value of the
  id, it could.

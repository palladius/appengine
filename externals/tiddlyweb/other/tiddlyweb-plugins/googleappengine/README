It is possible to run TiddlyWeb on Google's AppEngine service, 
with a bit of work. The process has evolved over time and become
more simple. If you've investigated this process in the past and
thought, no way, look again.

The code in this directory provides two categories of things:

* Code necessary for TiddlyWeb running on Google App Engine to
  work there.
* Code used to build the tiddlyweb google app engine application
  that can be deployed to the App Engine servers (or run locally
  with the SDK).

The first category includes:

* googledata.py: A StorageInterface implementation which stores
  bag, recipes and tiddlers in the App Engine data store. Revisions
  and Users are not currently handled (patches welcomed!).

* google_user_challenger.py: A TiddlyWeb challenger that launches
  an interface requesting the current user log into their google account.

* google_user_extractor.py: A TidlyWeb extractor that asks the App
  engine API for info on the current user.

* tiddlywebconfig.py: A basic config which establishes the necessary
  settings for the store, challenger and extractor to be used.

* main.py: A simple script which bridges App Engine and TiddlyWeb's
  WSGI nature.

* app.yaml: App Engine configuration for the current app.

In the second category is a Makefile which includes targets that
use pip, virtualenv, mkdir and symlinks to gather together the
required Python dependencies and build the necessary directory 
hierarchy.

The install process is as follows:

* Get and install the Google App Engine SDK for your OS from
  http://code.google.com/appengine/downloads.html

* Make sure you have pip and virtualenv, available from PyPI.

* In the directory with the Makefile:
** edit tiddlywebconfig.py to set the host information near the top
** edit app.yaml to set the name of the application if you will be 
   deploy to appspot.com.
** run 'make go'
** If that completes without errors, in the directory 'go' will
   be your ready to mount App Engine application.

There are some limitations to this setup:

* Though you may use google usernames in policies, there is as yet
  not storage for Roles.

* Tiddler revisions are not supported.

* Because an App Engine application is web only, there's no way to
  add content to the store other than through the web. Techniques
  for bootstrapping an instance are described below.

To get things started you will need at least one bag on the server.
More likely you'll want a few bags, a recipe, and a few tiddlers.
To add content you have a few options:

* You can make direct HTTP calls to the server, using curl or other 
  similar tools. See:
  http://tiddlyweb.peermore.com/wiki/recipes/docs/tiddlers?select=text:curl

* You can use tiddlywebweb to proxy local twanager actions through
  to the app engine web server. See:
  http://github.com/tiddlyweb/tiddlyweb-plugins/tree/master/tiddlywebweb
  This is the recommended method.

Practice wikitext_renderer for TiddlyWeb.

More docs to come.

NOTE: This module is incomplete. With some work it could become
a full featured renderer for a TiddlyWeb server that hosts 
tiddlers with Creole syntax. If you are interested in such a 
thing please post about it to the tiddlyweb goolge group:
